# IDS_project3
This is the repo for Project 3 and 4

The objective of this project is to generate a script queries a database. In this project, I have created a script in Python that runs SQL queries on a database instance created with Sqlite. This instance is created from a kaggle dataset on Youth & Adult Literacy Rates.

For project 4, I used the same literacy dataset and added FastAPI to output the query result in a web framework.
